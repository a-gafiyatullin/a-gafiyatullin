# 09-02: Scope

- Matching identifier declaration with uses;
- The **scope** of an identifier is the potion of a program in which that identifier is accessible;
- **Static scope** depends only on the program text;
- **Dynamic scope** depends on execution of the program.

# 09-03: Symbol Tables
- Much of semantic analysis can be expressed as a recursive descent of an AST;
- When performing semantic analysis on a portion of the AST, we need to know which identifiers are defined;
- A **symbol table** is a data structure that tracks the current bindings of identifiers;
- Semantic analysis requires multiple passes.

# 09-04: Types
1. The goal of type checking is to ensure that operations are used only with the correct types;
2. Three kinds of languages:
  - **Statically typed**: All or almost all checking of types is done as part of compilation;
  - **Dynamically typed**: Almost all checking of types is done as part of program execution;
  - **Untyped**: No type checking.

# 09-05: Type Checking
- The appropriate formalism for type checking is **logical rules of inference**.

# 09-06: Type Environments
1. A **type environment** gives types for free variables:
  - A type environment is a function from **ObjectIdentifiers** to **Types**;
  - A variable is free in an expression if it not defines within the expression.

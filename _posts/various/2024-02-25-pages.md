There is a lot of information on the Internet about the process of creating **Github Pages** website using **Jekyll**.

I've gone through this process recently, so I found some interesting resources that can help on that matter:

1. The [theme](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console?ref=jekyll-themes.com) of my website. Why exactly this:
  - It's **very simple** - no excessive elements, animations, and so on. Information is the center of attention;
  - Nice font;
  - Easy for setting and managing. I don't want to learn HTML/CSS and a lot of other stuff to make things work.
2. This website was supposed to contain equations, but, unfortunately, they didn't work out of the box:
  - Only one [guide](https://ionathan.ch/2022/05/22/jekyll-pages.html) helped me render equations on the pages.
    If you also suffer from these issues, please check the [github repo](https://github.com/a-gafiyatullin/a-gafiyatullin/tree/pages) of the site.
    Most of the work should be done in the [_config.yml](https://github.com/a-gafiyatullin/a-gafiyatullin/blob/pages/_config.yml) and
    [Gemfile](https://github.com/a-gafiyatullin/a-gafiyatullin/blob/pages/Gemfile) files.
  - It could be useful to check the official [documentation](https://katex.org/docs/options.html) about **Katex**.
    At least check **displayMode** option, because it defines how you will see your equations.
  - Don't forget about the [list of supported functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) for **Katex**.
    You will find what you should type for various symbols in your equations.
3. This website contains some code examples, so syntax highlighting is very essential for me:
  - It seems like the default syntax highlighter is quite good and supports a wide range of [languages](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).
  - If you are going to write some kind of pseudocode, I guess **Java** is your choice.
  - If the default syntax highlighter is not what you're looking for, try the [rouge](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62662067/i-cant-change-jekyll-syntax-highlighter-at-my-github-blog) syntax highlighter.
4. If you have problems with favicon (it's not displaying), check this [stackoverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35037482/favicon-with-github-pages).
5. And last but not least, index your page on Google using the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about):
  - It can be useful to create a site map; I used [XML-Sitemap.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) for this. But Google indexes my website very slowly.
  I guess because it's very young.

Good luck with your website!

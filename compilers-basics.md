These lecture notes are based on the course [Compilers](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/stanford-university-compilers) by [Alex Aiken](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/).

I highly recommend to take this course, and even, maybe, it's paid version (as I did and I've never regretted it).

In my opinion, It contains all the materials enough to start a career in the compilers field.
